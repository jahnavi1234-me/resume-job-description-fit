 Resume–Job Description Fit Analyzer 

---

 Project Description

The Resume–Job Description Fit Analyzer is an NLP-based AI system that evaluates how well a candidate’s resume matches a given job description.
It uses both traditional machine learning and transformer-based techniques to measure semantic similarity and predict candidate-job compatibility.

This system helps automate resume screening and improves recruitment efficiency by identifying suitable candidates quickly.

 Problem Statement

Recruiters often spend significant time manually reviewing resumes and comparing them with job descriptions. This process is time-consuming, subjective, and inefficient.

This project aims to build an AI-powered system that automatically analyzes resumes and job descriptions to determine how well a candidate fits a specific role using NLP and transformer-based semantic similarity techniques.
